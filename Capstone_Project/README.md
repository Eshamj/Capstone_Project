# Empirical Comparison of Cloud-Only and Hybrid Edge–Cloud Architectures for Real-Time IoT Analytics  

This project presents a comparative study between **Cloud-Only** and **Hybrid Edge–Cloud** architectures for real-time IoT data analytics.  
The objective was to evaluate trade-offs in **accuracy**, **latency**, and **cost** across two representative IoT datasets —  
**Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** and **Smart Mobility Traffic** — using the AWS Free Tier environment.

---

## 📘 Overview  

Cloud computing provides scalability and flexibility for large-scale analytics,  
but often suffers from latency and bandwidth limitations in time-sensitive IoT applications.  
To mitigate these, **hybrid edge–cloud architectures** perform partial processing closer to the data source,  
reducing data transmission and inference time.  

This study empirically compares both setups to quantify their real-world performance.

## 🧠 Architecture Summary  

| Architecture | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Cloud-Only** | Entire workflow (preprocessing, training, inference) performed on AWS EC2. |
| **Hybrid Edge–Cloud** | Data partially preprocessed locally (edge) and only reduced dataset uploaded to the cloud for final model training and inference. |

## ⚙️ Experimental Setup  

- **Platform:** AWS Free Tier (t3.micro EC2 instance, S3 storage)  
- **Languages & Tools:** Python 3.9+, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, boto3  
- **Datasets:**  
  - *UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR)*  
  - *Smart Mobility Traffic Dataset (Kaggle)*  
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Split:** 70% training / 30% testing

## 🔍 Key Observations  

- Cloud-only setups achieved slightly higher consistency in accuracy.  
- Hybrid setups demonstrated significantly lower latency and upload size,  
  showing their potential for real-time applications despite small accuracy drops.  
- AWS Free Tier provided cost-effective infrastructure for testing both setups.

## 🏁 Conclusion  

The hybrid edge–cloud approach, while slightly less accurate, achieved faster inference with reduced bandwidth and computation costs.  
This trade-off demonstrates that hybrid designs are well-suited for **real-time IoT analytics** such as smart city and mobility systems,  
where rapid response is more critical than marginal accuracy gains.
